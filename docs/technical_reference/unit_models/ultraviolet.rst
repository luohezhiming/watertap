Ultraviolet Advanced Oxidation Process
======================================

Introduction
------------

Ultraviolet (UV) light is widely used in the water industry to inactivate microorganisms by damaging their nucleic acid (Jagger, 1967), which prevents the pathogen from replicating and causing infection. Some contaminants resistant to biodegradation, such as N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), are susceptible to UV disinfection. The high oxidizing capability of UV is often used prior to chemical disinfection to ensure high microbial quality water as well as significantly reducing the chemical dosage required.

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are technologies involving the generation of highly reactive oxidative species, predominantly hydroxyl radicals. Unlike conventional chemical oxidation processes, such as using chlorine, which are selective as to which compounds they can degrade, AOPs are able to completely convert organic compounds into carbon dioxide, water and mineral acids. In addition, AOPs are feasible for full-scale use to destroy organic compounds because they generate hydroxyl radicals at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. Typically, the commercially available UV AOPs for industrial water treatment are:

1) UV light and hydrogen peroxide

2) UV light and ozone

3) UV light, hydrogen peroxide and ozone

UV AOPs can be  modeled at several different levels, depending on the known kinetic pathways and the modeling objectives.
